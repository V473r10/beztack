# React Component Patterns

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the component naming convention: PascalCase
- Export components as default exports for pages, named exports for reusable components
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props

## Component Organization
```typescript
// Component file structure
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from './types';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  className?: string;
}

export function MyComponent({ title, className }: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div className={cn("base-styles", className)}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## State Management
- Use React Query for server state management
- Use local state with useState for component-specific state
- Use context for global state that needs to be shared
- Implement proper loading and error states

## Form Handling
- Use TanStack Form for complex forms with validation
- Use React Hook Form for simpler forms
- Implement proper validation with Zod schemas
- Handle form submission with proper error handling

## Styling Patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS classes with the `cn` utility function
- Follow the design system patterns from shadcn/ui
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Hooks Patterns
- Create custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Implement cleanup functions for side effects
- Use useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization

## Context Usage
- Use context for global state that doesn't change frequently
- Implement proper TypeScript types for context values
- Use context providers at the appropriate level in the component tree
- Avoid prop drilling with context

## Component Composition
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper children patterns
- Use render props or compound components when appropriate
- Follow the single responsibility principle
