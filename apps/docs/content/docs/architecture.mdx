Beztack is structured as a monorepo using **Nx**, which lets us efficiently share code between the frontend and backend.

```

## Applications

### UI (`apps/ui`)
A **React** app built with **Vite**.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS.
- **State:** React Query / Context API.
- **Auth:** Better Auth client.

### API (`apps/api`)
A **Nitro** server (the engine behind Nuxt) that provides a fast and lightweight REST API.
- **Routes:** File-based routing in `server/routes`.
- **Database:** Drizzle ORM (if applicable) or direct connection.
- **Auth:** Better Auth Server.

## Shared Packages

Reusable code lives in `packages/` to keep apps clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

- **`packages/api-types`**: Contains TypeScript definitions for the API. This gives the frontend autocomplete and type safety when consuming the backend.
- **`packages/payments`**: Abstraction over payment providers (Mercado Pago and Polar), letting you swap or update billing logic without affecting the rest of the system.
- **`packages/cli`**: Project scaffolding plus Template Sync commands (`status`, `plan`, `apply`, `rollback`, `inspect`) for controlled template evolution.
